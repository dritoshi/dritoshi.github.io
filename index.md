## My interest
A multicellular organism is orchestrated by cell growth, death, differentiation, and communication at the single-cell level. To understand various crucial biological phenomena, we should massively perturb and measure transcriptomes and epigenomes at the single-cell level.

My research interest is the development of novel methods of omics analysis at the single-cell level, particularly by applying massively parallel DNA sequencing, genome editing, microfluidics, and machine learning. I focus on developing methods for quantifying and controlling cell function, fate, and cell-cell communication at the single-cell level. Our academic research team has already reported novel single-cell RNA-sequencing methods, such as Quartz-Seq2 and RamDA-seq, which are highly reproducible and sensitive methods of quantifying single-cell transcriptome.
